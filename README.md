# PortableAPRSTerminal
The aim of this project is to produce a PIC32-based portable APRS (automatic packet reporting system) terminal, primarily for use with amateur radio.  It *may* also incorporate a WiFi radio and/or license-free radio in future.

Brief hardware overview

- GPS: Fasttrax UP501
- Microcontroller: PIC32MX695F512H (my prototype is on a MiniMaximite board - see http://geoffg.net/mini-maximite.html)
- Screen: Winstar WG12864M 128x64 monochrome LCD screen (KS0108-based)
- Wifi radio (proposed) - ESP8266
- License-free radio (proposed) - Dorji DRF7020D13 GFSK data radio (433MHz)
- Keyboard (proposed) - some form of QWERTY keyboard *or* alphanumeric 4x4 keypad?
